# Save-Spotlight


#### Save Microsoft Windows Spotlight wallpapers to user/Pictures/Spotlight directory.


Windows 10 sets new background images to the lockscreen every few days. The feature knows as windows Spotlight. Almost all of these images are beautifull and some are so beautiful that you might want to save them to use as wallpaper. 

This script makes it 2 click job (not a double click) job to save Windows Spotlight images to the User/Pictures directoy. 

Download this script, right click on it, select 'Run with PowerShell' option, and voila, Spotlight images are now saved in 'C:\Users\\{user}\Pictures\Spotlight' directory. The directory is created for you if you don't have one. 

Everytime you run the script, new images(if available) will be added to the directory. Now you have a great source of images to use as Slideshow for Windows background.
